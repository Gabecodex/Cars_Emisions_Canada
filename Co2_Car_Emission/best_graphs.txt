X = Engine size (l), cylinders, fuel consumption city, fuel consumption HWY,
  fuel consumption comb
Y = Engine size (l), cylinders, fuel consumption city, fuel consumption HWY,
  fuel consumption comb

by my research using the output of the corelational matrix the best mach
possible for this data base is linear regression and line graph construction.
